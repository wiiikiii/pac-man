# pac-man
Vanilla javaScript Game with HTML and CSS

A super simple walkthourgh to coding Pac-Man in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
View [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) 

This version was forked and rewritten to minimize if/else and use move filters and finds on arrays.
Also a goal was to minimize the usage of timers.

### Inbuilt JavaScript functions I have used: 
* addEventListener()
* getElementById()
* querySelector()
* for Loop
* appendChild()
* createElement()
* push()
* if else statements
* classList
* switch case
* keyCode
* forEach()
* setTimeout
* Class
* constructor
* setInterval()
* removeEventListener

### Next steps:
- different speed for ghosts
- more intelligent ghosts tunning after pac man
- better graphics with svg
